# Jackal_trajectory_tracking

Python code for trajectotry tracking for the clearpath robot Jackal.

This includes two python scripts:
  - jackal_controller.py (class which handles all the necessary info that concerns the robot)
  - trajectory.py (Impliments a proportional controller for following a given trajectory. For now, it only         gets to a desired point)
